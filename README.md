# **Mind Map: Navigating Speech Collections Overview**  

**Mind Map** is a Web application designed to improve how users interact with large collections of spoken content, such as **lectures, podcasts, and seminars**. A **demo of the webpage** can be accessed at **[Mind Map Demo](https://mindmap.ux.uis.no/)** for a limited time.  

The Web application is developed by **Sirina Håland** and **Trond Karlsen Strøm** as part of their **Bachelor Thesis in Data Science** at the **University of Stavanger (UiS)**.  

Utilizing **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques, the application **categorizes spoken content** into intuitive, searchable topics, allowing users to quickly find information relevant to their interests and research needs.

## **Motivation**  

The **linear structure** of speech recordings (such as podcasts and talks) often makes **accessing stored information challenging**. **Mind Map** solves this by providing **intelligent navigation and browsing tools** to help users explore spoken content efficiently.  

This work **builds upon existing navigation methods**, incorporating **visual representations** to **enhance user engagement and interaction** with the content.

## **Features**  

✅ **AI-Enhanced Visuals**  
AI-generated visuals provide **a pictorial summary of talk content**, enhancing **user engagement**.  

✅ **Search and Filtering Capabilities**  
Allows users to **swiftly navigate** through topics using **keywords** or **curated filters**.  

✅ **Interactive Transcripts**  
Users can follow along with **synchronized transcripts** linked to the **audio playback**, helping them quickly **determine content relevance**.

## **How It Works**  

At the core of **Mind Map** is a **topic modeling system** that processes **audio transcripts** to **categorize topics** using techniques like:  
- **tf-idf** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)  
- **K-Means Clustering**  

This enables users to interact with a **responsive interface**, navigating **topics** and accessing **audio and transcripts directly**.  

The system leverages **AI technology** to improve **topic identification** and **visual representation**, making exploration both **engaging** and **insightful**.
